Instructions on how to use Github:

1. Everyone add yourselves on the watch list, so you know what's going on and who commits what.  
2. SEs will only work with pull requests. Nobody will be pushing code directly onto the repo.  
3. When working with the repo, fork the repo onto your own profiles, work on whatever, and then issue a PR on the organization repo.  
4. Test your code extensively so that there is not buggy code in any PR. TEs mentors will also test the code but just to be on a safe side, please no shoddy work to be submitted.  
5. As mentors we will run tests on your code and suggest changes. We will not sit to debug any code. So please write neat code, Django people follow the PEP8 instructions. Text editors and IDE now have many plugins to autoformat your code to PEP8.  
6. Commits should be atomic and well worded. That means, that you should commit after implementing a small feature like adding a model in models.py etc. And make your commits descriptive so that other people have no confusion. And please no use of slang or "texting language" in commits. Be formal and precise.
